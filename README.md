## More features
- Reviews (most likely in v1.0.0)
- Replying to a comment
- ~~liking a comment~~
- ~~Disliking a comment (in prog)~~
- ~~edit comment~~
- ~~delete comment~~
- Reporting a Comment
- ~~Custom comment badges~~
- ~~comment automoderation (malicous viruses, spam, etc)~~ 
- ~~safe mode (client size only filter)~~ (being moved to server side) (included in v0.1.0)
- ~~Episode syntax highlighting (ex: 00:01 jumps you to the first second of the video) (maybe comming)~~ (included in v0.1.0)
