This is an extension which replicates the comments on crunchyroll for how they used to look like (mostly). 
This is still a WIP and more features are on the way.

## More features
- Reviews
- Replying to a comment
- liking a comment
- Disliking a comment
- edit comment
- delete comment
- Reporting a Comment
- Custom comment badges
- comment automoderation (malicous viruses, spam, etc)
- safe mode (client size only filter)
- Episode syntax highlighting (ex: 00:01 jumps you to the first second of the video) (maybe comming)
